# CapstoneProject
## This will be the repo for my Capstone Project as Galvanize San Francisco.

The project will focus on predicting DotA 2 match outcomes. The project proposal in the same directory will elaborate the goal of this project. However, here's the TL;DR:

1. Work on a set of 50,000 ranked matches in DotA 2 before the infamous 7.00 patch, and later expand into an even larger dataset offered by yasp.co on Academic Torrents.
2. Data for each game contains massive amounts of information, I would engineer features through aggregation and normalization to make the data more informative.
3. Make player brackets based on a more objective skill rating (not the Valve official MMR); I will work to devise such a system.
4. Run different classification model on every player bracket to account for the differences in player skills, which can extend to how they think about strategies.
5. Recommend best hero compositions/strategies for players in bracket i with max predicted win-rate of the model in bracket i+1.

It is important to note that my project outlook can still change as I dive into it for the next 3~4 weeks. I will keep updating this repo to account for any change in plans.
